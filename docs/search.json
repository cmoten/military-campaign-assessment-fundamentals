    "text": "Preface\nMilitary operations today unfold in environments of growing complexity, strategic ambiguity, and rapid change. In this context, commanders and their staffs must not only execute plans, but continuously assess whether those plans are achieving the intended effects—and whether the effects themselves are relevant to evolving objectives.\nYet despite the centrality of assessment to military effectiveness, the practice remains uneven, often constrained by narrow definitions, limited analytic tools, and unclear linkages between operational activities and strategic ends. Traditional methods of measurement—focused largely on performance metrics—often fail to capture the deeper questions that assessment must answer: Are we doing the right things? Are we achieving the right effects? And how can we know?\nThis book, Military Assessment Fundamentals, provides some inghight to these questions. It is designed to support both military planners and analysts in building better frameworks for evaluating campaigns, operations, and strategic efforts. Grounded in joint doctrine, but informed by recent advances in decision science, systems thinking, and strategic design, this book offers a contemporary view of assessment that treats it as a core function of command—not a post hoc report.\nThroughout the chapters, you will encounter concepts such as analytic uncertainty, causal logic, and deep vs. surface uncertainty. These are not merely academic abstractions. They reflect the real-world conditions under which military decisions must be made and adapted. You will also see how assessment connects to planning, design, and adaptation, enabling a more agile and informed approach to strategic execution.\nThis book is not a manual. It is a way to think about assessment that transcends templates and checklists. Whether you are a planner, a commander, or an analyst, the goal is to equip you with the principles, language, and mindset necessary to assess what matters most.\nI hope this work contributes to a broader conversation about military assessment and helps advance both the practice and profession of command.\nLTC Cardy Moten III\nStuttgart, Germany\nAugust 2025",

    "section": "1.3 Assessment as a Prerequisite to Adaptation",
    "text": "1.3 Assessment as a Prerequisite to Adaptation\nCombatant Command Campaign Plans (CCPs) and country plans are dynamic, continuously evolving through cycles of implementation, evaluation, and revision. Because plans rarely unfold as anticipated, Combatant Command (CCMD) planners must extend their planning horizon annually to maintain a forward-looking posture. This dual imperative requires balancing the execution of ongoing operations with the need to plan for future contingencies.\nIn this environment, assessment becomes a prerequisite to effective adaptation. But assessment is not just about measuring performance or progress—it is fundamentally about measuring and reducing uncertainty. In military operations, uncertainty arises from the complexity of the operational environment, the unpredictability of adversaries, and the limitations of available information. By systematically observing and evaluating how operations affect outcomes, assessment helps commanders determine whether current approaches are likely to succeed—or whether they must be adjusted or abandoned.\nFollowing Hubbard’s definition, measurement is “a quantitatively expressed reduction in uncertainty based on one or more observations” (Hubbard 2014). This perspective is particularly relevant for campaign assessment: the goal is not only to track implementation but to reduce ambiguity about what works, what doesn’t, and why.\nThe following 13 propositions, summarized from contemporary scholarship (Hickey, Bradford, and Perez 2019), offer a theoretical framework for integrating uncertainty into military design and assessment:\n\nEnvironment as Obstacle Course – Military environments are composed of dynamic systems that commanders must navigate.\nEnvironment as Landscape to Change – Commanders are tasked not only with navigating but also with reshaping the environment.\nInterventions as Causal Hypotheses – Every military action implies a theory of cause and effect.\nNeed for Causal Literacy – Military professionals must be trained to craft and evaluate causal claims.\nTypology of Causal Logics – Reductive causation (structural, institutional, ideational, psychological) underpins military reasoning.\nMastering Causal Frameworks – Commanders must understand causal logics to assess and adapt effectively.\nComplexity Limits Certainty – The world’s complexity reduces the reliability of single-cause explanations.\nAssessment as Experimentation – Interventions should be approached as hypotheses tested through assessment.\nFocus on Political Ends – Military efforts must align with and support broader political objectives.\nReevaluate Measures of Effectiveness (MoEs) and Measures of Performance (MoPs) – Traditional measures of effectiveness and performance are insufficient for complex goals.\nAssessment is Difficult but Essential – Despite challenges, continuous assessment is indispensable.\nIntegration of Planning and Assessment – Planners and assessors should work collaboratively throughout the planning cycle.\n‘For the Sake Of’ vs. ‘In Order To’ Objectives – Objectives should prioritize purpose and direction over narrowly defined end-states.\n\nThese propositions highlight that uncertainty is not a problem to be eliminated, but a reality to be engaged thoughtfully. Assessment is not merely technical—it is cognitive, adaptive, and continuous. It helps leaders make decisions in complex and unpredictable environments, not by providing perfect knowledge, but by systematically reducing what is unknown.\nUltimately, campaign assessment enables the Combatant Commander (CCDR) to make strategic recommendations to the Secretary of Defense (SecDef) and broader Department of Defense (DoD) leadership. These insights guide both internal planning cycles and higher-level decisions about force structure, budgeting, and legislative requests through the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).",

    "section": "1.4 Understanding Analytic Uncertainty",
    "text": "1.4 Understanding Analytic Uncertainty\nAccording to Croft (2018), analytic uncertainty is “a type of uncertainty that consists of five components of deep and surface uncertainty that is useful for planning and military assessments.” Table 1.1 lists those five elements, which we will discuss in detail in the following section.\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Elements of Analytic Uncertainty\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Uncertainty (unknowables)\nSurface Uncertainty (unknowns)\n\n\n\n\nComplexity\nFactual Uncertainty\n\n\nNon-linearity\nPrecision Uncertainty\n\n\nAdaptation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1 Components\n\n1.4.1.1 Surface Uncertainty\nSurface uncertainty refers to uncertainty that is visible and acknowledged, but not deeply understood. It often arises from ambiguities or contradictions in observable data or misalignment between facts and interpretation. Surface uncertainty is the “tip of the iceberg” — it’s apparent, but may conceal deeper issues beneath.\nSome key characteristics of surface uncertainty are:\n\nOften linked to conflicting or unclear indicators.\nMight be recognized by decision-makers but not resolved.\nCan result from over-reliance on dashboards, over-simplified metrics, or data with unclear context.\n\nIf not properly mitigated, surface uncertainty can lead to:\n\nRisk of misinterpretation: Decision-makers may prematurely resolve uncertainty by defaulting to assumptions or bias.\nPlanning fragility: Plans built on surface-level observations without deeper validation may be brittle under stress.\nCognitive bias exposure: It invites confirmation bias and motivated reasoning when stakeholders pick evidence that supports preferred narratives.\n\nAs a mitigation measure, we will then learn more about the components of surface uncertainty: factual uncertainty and precision uncertainty.\n\n1.4.1.1.1 Factual Uncertainty\nFactual uncertainty arises when information is incomplete, inaccurate, outdated, or ambiguous. It’s about not having the correct facts to begin with, and it reflects gaps in what we know or what we’re aware of. Some examples of this type of uncertainty are:\n\nMissing intelligence about an adversary’s troop movement.\nLack of updated terrain maps.\nAmbiguous language in diplomatic communication.\n\nBased on Figure 1.1, this form of uncertainty corresponds to known unknowns (things we are aware of but don’t understand) and unknown unknowns (things we are neither aware of nor understand).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Factual Uncertainty\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1.1.2 Precision Uncertainty\nPrecision uncertainty refers to situations where we have quantitative information, but the information is imprecise or subject to variation. This type of uncertainty often emerges when using probabilistic models or estimates that inherently involve a degree of variability or error.\nSome examples of this type of uncertainty are:\n\nForecasting casualty estimates with wide confidence intervals.\nUsing intelligence or other staff estimate reports that assign vague probabilities (e.g., “likely”).\nPlanning based on weather predictions with large error margins.\n\nIn practice, analysts in the above situations can use some of the models depicted in Figure 1.2, but these models generally are not utilized in assessment frameworks. A way to mitigate these risks in assessment frameworks would be to use techniques like Bayesian models and Monte Carlo simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Precision Uncertainty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1.2 Deep Uncertainty\nDeep uncertainty arises when stakeholders do not know or cannot agree on:\n\nThe system model (how things work).\nThe probability distributions for key variables.\nThe value trade-offs involved in making decisions.\n\nUnlike surface uncertainty, which is visible but unclear, deep uncertainty means the underlying mechanisms are fundamentally opaque or contested. It’s common in complex, dynamic military, geopolitical, and socio-technical systems.\n\n1.4.1.2.1 Complexity\nThe operational environment consists of many interconnected parts whose relationships are not easily decomposed or predictable. Changes in one area can cause ripple effects elsewhere. Some examples of this component are:\n\nA change in local governance affects regional security, economy, and foreign relations.\nCoalition operations where each partner’s decisions affect the others in non-obvious ways.\n\nBy understanding this component, assessment analysts will begin to understand the difficulty in tracing cause and effect, and that emergent events are common even when they are not planned for (Air Land Sea Space Application Center 2020, 16, 21).\nFigure 1.3 depicts a vital tool to mitigate the previously discussed risks, and that is systems thinking models. We will discuss these models more later in the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Complexity\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1.2.2 Non-Linearity\nInputs and outputs are not proportional — small actions can have significant effects or vice versa. The system exhibits unpredictable or chaotic behavior at times.\nWhile it does not completely encapsulate this component, Figure 1.4 depicts a non-linear process. Other examples of this are:\n\nA minor political assassination triggers a large-scale war.\nLarge troop increases fail to shift insurgent activity.\n\nA key aspect of nonlinearity is that forecasting future events is highly error-prone, and success or failure may hinge on tipping points or threshold effects. To mitigate these risks, an assessment analyst needs to utilize methods and tools that lend themselves to range estimates and sensitivity analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Non-Linearity\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1.2.3 Adaptation\nActors within the system — including adversaries, allies, civilians, and even the organization itself — observe, learn, and change behavior in response to actions.\nFor instance:\n\nAn adversary adjusts tactics after observing drone strikes.\nLocal populations change cooperation patterns based on perceived legitimacy.\n\nFurthermore, the environment is dynamic and responsive, and the adage of plans not making it past first contact still holds. A key mitigation for this concept involves systems thinking models and the development of an agile assessment framework.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Implications for Planning\nBy understanding the concept of surface uncertainty, assessment analysts can better define these components of uncertainty and ultimately measure them in a meaningful way. Analysts can also qualify risks and opportunities.\nSimilarly, understanding deep uncertainty at a conceptual level provides us with the means to better deal with it. According to Croft (2018):\n\nThe remedy that analysts must employ in the face of complexity, nonlinearity, and adaptation is theory. Theories, by their nature, are uncertain, and planners in early-stage operational design work must again avoid the assumption trap. By engaging with deep uncertainty, planners take on the challenge of building multiple worldviews as possible explanations of system behavior and change during conflict.\n\nUltimately, instead of relying on the process of creating and validating assumptions, assessment analysts can now leverage additional analytic tools that make the engineering of assessment frameworks based on the previous thirteen principles possible.",

These assessments are descriptive and generated by the entity that is responsible for executing the program or OAI, and inform a progress assessment.\n\n\nEffectiveness Assessments\nEffectiveness assessments measure the contribution of a program or OAI towards meeting an objective. These assessments are diagnostic and generated by the staff directorates that are responsible for planning and monitoring the programs and OAIs over time. This assessment also informs a progress assessment.\n\n\nProgress Assessments\nProgress assessments measure toward one or more objectives.

The manual notes that assessment frameworks should be grounded in clearly stated theories of causation—explaining why and how inputs are expected to achieve desired end-states—and that these theories directly inform assessment techniques, indicators, and interpretation (Air Land Sea Space Application Center 2020, see Chapter II).\nA review of broader literature highlights a foundational guide developed by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, which introduced the concept of logic models. In the context of operational design, a logic model functions as a theory of change, explicitly depicting the hypothesized causal pathways and assumptions that underpin a campaign, operation, or program.\nAccording to the W.K.

    "section": "2.3 Logic Model Components",
    "text": "2.3 Logic Model Components\nA logic model visually and systematically represents how a program works. It links program resources, activities, outputs, and outcomes to clearly illustrate the relationships among the program’s elements and its intended results. Planners, implementers, and evaluators commonly use logic models to design, execute, assess, and communicate programs. By doing so, they promote shared understanding among stakeholders and establish accountability and clarity in measuring success.\n\n2.3.1 Inputs (Resources)\nInputs refer to the foundational resources required to launch and sustain a program. These include human resources (such as staff, volunteers, or subject-matter experts), financial resources (budgets, grants, donations), material assets (equipment, facilities, supplies), and intangible assets (community partnerships, organizational reputation, data systems). Inputs are not outputs or results themselves, but they enable the program to function. A clear understanding of inputs is crucial for determining program feasibility and scope. Inputs also serve as a baseline for accountability, ensuring that there is alignment between investments and what the program aims to accomplish. The quality, availability, and appropriateness of these resources will significantly affect the program’s effectiveness and the plausibility of achieving desired outcomes. In short, inputs are the “raw materials” for program implementation.\n\n\n2.3.2 Activities\nProgram staff carry out activities as the core processes or interventions using available inputs. These activities consist of the actual operations or services delivered to achieve the program’s objectives—such as conducting workshops, developing curricula, offering technical assistance, providing training, or running outreach campaigns. Designers typically express activities using action verbs to reflect what the program “does,” ensuring they align with the needs of the target population and the intended outcomes. These actions bridge resource use with measurable results (outputs and outcomes). To plan activities effectively, program designers must clearly understand the intervention’s logic—why they expect a particular activity to lead to change. During evaluations, analysts assess the fidelity and quality of activity implementation to determine whether the program or external factors produced the observed results.\n\n\n2.3.3 Outputs\nOutputs are the immediate, tangible products or deliverables resulting from a program’s activities. These are typically quantified and expressed in terms such as “number of participants trained,” “classes conducted,” or “manuals distributed.” Outputs do not reflect the impact or effectiveness of a program; instead, they indicate that the completion of activities as intended. Outputs are proxies for performance indicators during implementation to monitor progress and operational efficiency. While outputs alone do not demonstrate success, they are essential for program accountability and process evaluation. They also serve as a necessary precondition for achieving outcomes—no outcomes can occur without outputs, but outputs alone are not sufficient. By distinguishing between outputs and outcomes, program evaluators can avoid the common mistake of confusing effort with effect.\n\n\n2.3.4 Outcomes\nOutcomes represent the changes or benefits resulting from a program’s outputs. They can be short-term (changes in knowledge, attitudes, or skills), intermediate (changes in behavior, decision-making, or organizational practice), or long-term (changes in social, economic, or environmental conditions). Outcomes provide evidence of program effectiveness and are central to any meaningful evaluation. Unlike outputs, outcomes measure the value and impact of the program, not just completion, but achievement. Well-defined outcomes should be specific, measurable, realistic, and aligned with the program’s overall goals. They also must be attributable, at least in part, to the program’s activities and outputs. Importantly, outcomes are not always linear or guaranteed; they depend on various assumptions and external influences. Measuring outcomes helps organizations understand their value proposition and refine future strategies.\n\n\n2.3.5 Impact\nPrograms aim to contribute to broad, long-term, and often societal-level changes known as impacts. These high-level effects include reducing poverty, improving public health, increasing economic stability, and advancing educational attainment. Organizations typically align impacts with their institutional missions or policy goals, recognizing that such changes often emerge years after a program concludes. Unlike more immediate and attributable outcomes, impacts result from a complex interplay of factors, many of which lie beyond the program’s control. Consequently, evaluators rarely attribute impacts directly to a single program; instead, they recognize the program’s contribution to broader change.\nMeasuring impact requires a long-term perspective and often involves partnerships with external evaluators, the use of secondary data, or follow-up studies. In logic models, impact serves as the north star, guiding the design and alignment of all prior components: activities, outputs, and outcomes. A strong logic model will show a plausible pathway from what the program does (activities) to what it achieves (outcomes) and ultimately how it contributes to impact. Being transparent about intended impact ensures that programs remain focused on meaningful change, rather than simply delivering services. It also helps communicate value to funders, stakeholders, and the broader public.",
